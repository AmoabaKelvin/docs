## What is ishortn?

ishortn is a Dynamic Links and URL shortener that allows you to shorten links, track the clicks, and get analytics on your links. It is a free and open source project that is built with NextJS.

I integrated the dynamic linking feature into this project since firebase is going to be shutting down the service in August of 2025. 
This has led to the panic of many projects that rely on the service, and alternatives to the firebase dynamic linking service are quite expensive.

I hope this project can help those who are in need of a dynamic linking service.


## Features and Roadmap
- Dynamic Links (Apple universal links & Android app links)
- Link shortening
- Link analytics (clicks, countries, devices, browsers, cities)
- Link expiration
- Link QR code generation
- Link password protection (coming soon)
- Geo targeting (coming soon)

Not all features are available yet, but they are coming soon. If you would like to request a feature, please open an issue on the [Github repository](

) or send me an email at [kel.amoaba@gmail.com](mailto:kel.amoaba@gmail.com).

## How do I keep the servers running?
Well, since this is a free service, I try my best to foot the bill for the servers. 

But that is not always possible, so if you would like to help out, you can donate to my  [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/kelvinamoaba) page.
This will go a long way to keep the servers buzzing and the project alive.
