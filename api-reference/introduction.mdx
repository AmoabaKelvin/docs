## Welcome

To get started, you can use the API Playground to test out the API endpoints. Please know that you will require a valid API key to use the API Playground.
You can generate an API key by visiting the [settings](https://ishortn.ink/dashboard/tokens).

## Authentication

To authenticate with the API, you will need to include your API key in the `x-api-key` header.

```
Method Endpoint HTTP/1.1
Host: ishortn.ink
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```
